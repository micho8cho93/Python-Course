# 📋 Class Attendance Counter

Welcome to the **Counter** project! In this task, you’ll build a Python program to help teachers keep track of class attendance. This is a practical way to apply your understanding of **user input, conditionals, loops, lists, and functions**.

## 🧪 Project Overview

You’ll complete two exercises that gradually build in complexity:

### ✅ Exercise 1: Basic Attendance Counter  
- Ask the user for the **class size**.
- Prompt the user to record whether each student is **present or absent**.
- Display the **total number of present and absent students** at the end.

### ✅ Exercise 2: Advanced Attendance Tracker  
- Ask the user for the **names of each student** in the class.
- Prompt the user to mark each student as **present or absent** by name.
- Display:
  - The **total number of present and absent students**.
  - A list of the **names of present and absent students**.

## ✏️ Code Comments and Explanation

You are **required** to add comments at the **bottom of your code** explaining:
- How you developed your solution step-by-step
- Which **methods** and **functions** you used and why

> ⚠️ **Important**: Failure to include your explanation will result in a loss of points.

## 🧪 How to Test Your Code

Testing your program is essential to make sure it works as expected.

To run and test your code:
1. Open your Python file in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
2. Click the **"Run"** button in the top-right corner, or use the shortcut:
   - `Ctrl + F5` (Windows)
   - `Cmd + F5` (Mac)

You should test your program with different inputs to check that it handles both expected and unexpected cases correctly.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By completing this project, you will:
- Practice using **loops** and **conditional logic** effectively
- Learn to work with **user input** and **lists**
- Understand how to build simple, real-world applications
- Begin to think about how to **test** and **validate** your code
