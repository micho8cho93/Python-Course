# üßÆ Calculator Project

Welcome to the **first set of activities** in this Python course!

In this project, you‚Äôll build a calculator by applying your knowledge of:
- **Statements**
- **Expressions**
- **Operators**
- **Conditionals**

These exercises are designed to give you a solid foundation in writing basic logic-driven programs.

## üìò Exercises Overview

There are **three exercises** in increasing order of difficulty. 

### ‚úÖ Start Here: `calc_v1.py`
You must complete `calc_v1.py` **before moving on** to the other versions. Each exercise includes in-code `#comments` with instructions to guide you.

### üß† Instructions
- Follow the comments in each `.py` file to complete the activity.
- After finishing each exercise, run the provided test file to check your solution.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Reflection (Required)

At the **bottom of your code**, you **must include a comment section** that explains:
- How you developed your solution (your thought process)
- Which Python methods, functions, or techniques you used

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This reflection is part of your assessment. Failing to include it will result in lost points.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Code

Testing is a key part of being a developer. The provided tests will:
- Automatically run your functions with different inputs
- Check if your output matches the expected result
- Show how many tests passed or failed
- Identify **which function** and **which input** caused a failure

### üß™ How to Run Tests in VS Code

You must be using an IDE like **VS Code** to run test files.

**Two ways to run tests:**

1. Click the **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button in the top-right corner of VS Code  
2. Use the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** inside VS Code:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_calc_v1.py
